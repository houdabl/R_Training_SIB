# R_Training_SIB
This repository contains my work based on the "First Steps with R in Life Sciences" two-day course from SIB Training. The course is designed for beginners to learn the basics of R, including its syntax, environment, and common commands for data exploration and analysis.

## Overview
This material introduces R and RStudio (a development environment for R) in an interactive way. It includes example datasets for practicing:

* Data manipulation
* Graphical exploration
* Statistical hypothesis testing

## Prerequisites
Before diving into the material, ensure you have:

* **R** installed (available here : https://cran.r-project.org/)
* **RStudio** installed (available here : https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

## Organization
The course content is divided into two main parts, corresponding to the two days of training:

**Day 1**: Basics of R
       Getting started with R and RStudio
       Understanding common data types in R
       Reading and writing data files
**Day 2**: Visualization and Statistical Analysis
       Creating and customizing data visualizations
       Performing basic statistical analysis in R
(Note: This is not a statistics course, but an introduction to R's statistical tools.)

## Resources in this Repository
* Slides: A mix of theory and hands-on instructions.
* Data: Example datasets for practice, located in the datasets/ folder.
Solutions: Code solutions for practical exercises in the solutions/ folder.

## My Contributions
I am reproducing and applying the concepts from the course, documenting my learning journey here. Feel free to explore the materials and examples, and use them as a resource for your own learning. Any insights or improvements are welcome!

**Note** : I have not reproduced all the course material. If you want to access the full training content, you can find it here : https://github.com/sib-swiss/first-steps-with-R-training
