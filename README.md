# R_Training_SIB
This repository contains my work based on the "First Steps with R in Life Sciences" two-day course from SIB Training. The course is designed for beginners to learn the basics of R, including its syntax, environment, and common commands for data exploration and analysis.

# Overview
This material introduces R and RStudio (a development environment for R) in an interactive way. It includes example datasets for practicing:
* Data manipulation
* Graphical exploration
* Statistical hypothesis testing
